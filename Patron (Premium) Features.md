Those who gain access to patron features will need to [Join the Support Guild](https://discord.gg/4P6ApdPAF7) to maintain their patron status, **which may be done here *OR* directly on the Patreon site.**

## General Information
These patron statuses are distinctive and unique statuses within the support guild that will allow Lord Bottington to keep up with those who choose to become a patron.
+ You will receive the appropriate status upon purchase of the patron features and upon joining the support guild.
+ Once the appropriate status is obtained in the Support Guild, you may return to your guild and use the `/patron` directive again to enable the features for your guild.
  - In doing so, you will be granted access to patron features by submitting your guild data (guild name, ID, etc...) to Lord Bottington to maintain.
  - Your patron status will remain until your status expires in the Support Guild from a lack of payment or you leave the Support Guild.
+ If you leave the Support Guild or do not maintain your monthly payments, your patron status will be removed and your access to patron features will be revoked until one of the patron statuses are regained.
  - Lord Bottington will also notify you (via Discord DM) of a loss of patron status in the Support Guild.

+ Once payment has been received by Lord Bottington and your chosen patron status is acquired in the Support Guild, Lord Bottington will message you (via Discord DM) of the updates to your patron status and instructions on what to do next.
+ Once received, you **MUST** use the `/patron` directive in the guild you want to enable patron features for.
+ *Please note that you are only able to enable patron features for **1** guild of your choosing.*
  - If you would like to change this guild, please contact an admin or the automaton owner (XxJSweezeyxX) directly in the Support Guild or by email at ***xxjsweezeyxx@gmail.com*** to resolve this issue and correct your patron information accordingly.
