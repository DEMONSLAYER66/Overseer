## Patron Features

I also offer *exclusive* services for members who are willing to provide payments! I handle all payment information through [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/LordBottington) and will assign users specified roles in the Support Guild based on their patron tier. You may [visit this site](https://www.patreon.com/LordBottington) and see the exclusive services that I offer by going to the *Patreon site* below, good sir.

You may use my [`/patron`](https://github.com/xxjsweezeyxx/Lord-Bottington/blob/main/Full%20Directive%20List.md#patron) directive in your guild to find out more information or go directly to the Patreon site. Once the subscription is obtained for your guild, you may join the support guild and submit your guild information using this [`/patron`](https://github.com/xxjsweezeyxx/Lord-Bottington/blob/main/Full%20Directive%20List.md#patron) directive! Otherwise, I will be unable to determine if you are a current patron or not...

*I look forward to serving you and hope to see you in your guild, good sir!*
